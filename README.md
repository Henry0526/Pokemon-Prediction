# Pokemon-Prediction
Practice to use the Kaggle Dataset.

### 使用環境 Envirmental
+ Jupyter Notebook
+ windows 10

<b>需要使用的套件版本我放在requirements.txt裡面了</b></br>
<b>Windows 10 用戶會需要額外的套件我放在wheel裡面了</b></br>
<b>All the needed module had been listed in the requirements.txt.</b></br>
<b>Windows 10 users will need to install some bouns module which I put them into the wheel folder.</b></br>
### Data Image
內部呈現的是我針對多種資料視覺化的圖所做的練習</br>
The images inside this folder are the maps that I used to practice to illustrate many kinds of data visualization.
1. [Scatter Map](https://github.com/Henry0526/Pokemon-Prediction/tree/master/Data%20Image/All%20Kinds%20Scatter/Normal) [  "Type1"   vs all feature ]
2. [Pairplot](https://github.com/Henry0526/Pokemon-Prediction/tree/master/Data%20Image/BoxPlots)       [all feature vs all feature ]
3. [BoxPlots](https://github.com/Henry0526/Pokemon-Prediction/blob/master/Data%20Image/Pairplot.png)      [all feature vs all "Type 1"]
4. Heat Map

### Data sets
裡面放的是我在 [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon/kernels) 裡載的資料集</br>
[Kaggle Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon/kernels)
- Name: Name of each pokemon
- Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks
- Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2
- Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is
- HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
- Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)
- Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
- SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)
- SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks
- Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round
